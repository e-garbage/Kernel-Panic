## Kernel Panic
Mini synthetizer / noise box project that fit inside a standard tin can.

## Kernel Panic Code

Code is based on the very nice and powerfull Mozzi library (ver 1.0.3), you can find more info about it here:
https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/

Code logic as well as circuit design was heavily inspired by the incredible work of Hagiwo:

This sound module was first developped as a Eurorack 3 knob  module, but I prefered to publish the more straight foward tin can version.
